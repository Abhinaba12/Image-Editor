# Image-Editor

Here's a brief overview of what each feature does---

1.Brightness Adjustment: This feature allows you to change the overall brightness of an image. Increasing brightness makes the image lighter, while decreasing brightness makes it darker.

2.Saturation Adjustment: Saturation refers to the intensity or vividness of colors in an image. Increasing saturation makes colors more vibrant, while decreasing saturation makes them more muted or grayscale.

3.Grayscale Conversion: Grayscale conversion transforms a color image into shades of gray, removing color information. This can be useful for creating black and white images or for certain artistic effects.

4.Inversion: Inversion, also known as negative, flips the colors in an image so that each color's RGB values are subtracted from 255. This creates a sort of "photo negative" effect where light areas become dark and vice versa.
